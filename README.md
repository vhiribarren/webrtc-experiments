WebRTC Experiments
==================

This project contains a tiny signalling server to associate different
WebRTC clients, as well as some web pages with some experimentations
about WebRTC.

Install & Usage
---------------

    $ npm install
    $ node server.js

The server port can be configured in the config.js file. By default, the port
used is 8080 so you can then open your web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080
